Hi, my name is Sergei. This is my main GitHub account where I create projects and contribute to existing ones. Take a look at [or-release](https://github.com/orlovedev/or-release) - it's a great tool for removing the hustle from versioning your code (in any programming language ☝️).

I work as a software architect. I have a blog ([https://orlove.dev](https://orlove.dev)) where I write about "softer" dev stuff. I also learn to draw so you may occasionally see my clumsy images here and there.
