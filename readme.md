Hi, my name is Sergei. This is my main GitHub account where I create projects and contribute to existing ones. Take a look at [or-release](https://github.com/orlowdev/or-release) - it's a great tool for removing the hustle from versioning your code (in any programming language ☝️).
I also maintain [gatsby-source-notion-api](https://github.com/orlowdev/gatsby-source-notion-api) that aims at making [Notion](https://notion.so) a perfect CMS for Gatsby.

I work as a software architect. I have a blog ([https://orlow.dev](https://orlow.dev)) where I write about "softer" dev stuff. I also learn to draw so you may occasionally see my clumsy images here and there.
