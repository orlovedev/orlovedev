Hi, my name is Sergei. This is my main GitHub account where I create projects and contribute to existing ones. Take a look at [@priestine/versions](https://github.com/priestine/versions) - it's a great tool for removing the hustle from versioning your code (and it's programming language agnostic ☝️).

I work as a software architect. Apart from that, I sometimes remember to write to the blog of mine at [https://orlove.dev](https://orlove.dev), and learn to draw so you may occasionally see my clumsy images here and there.
